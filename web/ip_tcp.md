# IP (Internet Protocol)

Each computer on the internet has an IP address that differentiates it from the other computers. 

**Internet Protocol (IP)** is the set of rules that determine how information is sent over the internet. 
  * When one computer requests information from another, the data requested is broken down into "packets" and sent from one location to another. 
  * The packets all have the address of the sender and receiver. 
  * The packets can take different routes to get from one location to another, but the main thing is that all the packets get to the right location.

# TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)

In TCP, a connection between the sender and receiver is created and maintained until all of the data is transfered. It's the TCP that knows how the packets fit together to make up the data being sent. Once all the packets are received, the packets are assembled into a file and then are delivered to the application making the call for data.
