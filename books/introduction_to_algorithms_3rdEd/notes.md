# Algorithms

* A sequence of computational steps that transforms some input into the output. 
* Algorithms are efficient in terms of space and time. 
  * space refers to the memory available 
  * time refers to the amount of time it takes for the computer to run the algorithm.

** Parallelism **
 * computers are designed to contain several processing cores that function in parallel to one another. Because of this, algorithms need to be designed with parallelism in mind in order to best utilize a computer's multi-core processor.

** Space Complexity **
  * measure of how much memory the algorithm takes up

** Time complexity **
  * measure of how much time the algorithm takes to complete
