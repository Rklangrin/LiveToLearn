# Loops 

## For loop

```java
  for (int n = 0; n < 3; n++) {
    execute_this_code
  }
```

## While loop

```java
  while (true) {
    execute_this_code
  }
```

## Do While loop

```java
  do {
    execute this code
  } while (true);
```

Do while loops will execute the code block at least once before looking to see if the condition is true. 

* You can **break** and **continue** loops.
