# Loops 

## For loop

```java
  for (int n = 0; n < 3; n++) {
    execute_this_code
  }
```

## For Each Loop

```java
  for (Integer points : gameScores){
    System.out.println(points);
  }
```
This reads like this: For each integer element (called points here) in gameScores, print out the value of the points.

## While loop

```java
  while (true) {
    execute_this_code
  }
```

## Do While loop

```java
  do {
    execute this code
  } while (true);
```

Do while loops will execute the code block at least once before looking to see if the condition is true. 

* You can **break** and **continue** loops.
