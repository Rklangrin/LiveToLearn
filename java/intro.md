# Java
- compiled language
- Object-oriented 
- code is written in .java files and the code is compiled into 'bytecode' in .class files. 
- The bytecode can gthen be run on a Java Virtual Machine (JVM)

Once .class files are created, the 'java' command can be used to run the java program from a JRE (Java runtime environment)

## Garbage Collector
- Java has a program running in the background that keeps track of objects you've created, and when the object is no longer needed the garbage collector automatically takes back the memory that was assigned to them.
  - This is called **implicit memory management**.

## Java Development Kit (JDK)
Program for developing Java applications and applets. Included:
  - Java runtime environment (JRE)
    - Includes JVM, code libraries, and components necessary for running java programs
  - Interpreter 
  - Compiler
  - Archiver (jar)

## Generalizations
* To instantiate an object, use the word "new" before the class name. 
* Must always use accessSpecifiers when declaring variables.
